[My K012 Project](https://github.com/psga) is my submission for the K012 project, based on the [enscribe.dev](https://enscribe.dev) repository—a personal information-security blog built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), TypeScript, and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). It is a fork of the original repository available at [jktrn/enscribe.dev](https://github.com/jktrn/enscribe.dev), leveraging the [timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog/) blogging template.
