# Concepts to consider
 ### Git Commit
In Git, a **commit** represents a snapshot of the repository at a specific point in time. It captures the state of all files tracked by Git, including their contents and directory structure, at the moment the commit is created. Each commit has a unique identifier (usually a SHA-1 hash) that distinguishes it from other commits in the repository.

#### Components of a Commit:
- **Snapshot**: Represents the complete state of files at the time of the commit.
- **Author**: The person who made the commit.
- **Timestamp**: The date and time when the commit was made.
- **Commit message**: A description provided by the author explaining the changes made in the commit.

#### Purpose of Commits:
- **Version Control**: Commits allow developers to track changes made to the codebase over time. This facilitates collaboration, rollback to previous states, and identification of who made specific changes.
- **History**: Commits form a chronological history of modifications, making it easier to understand the evolution of the project.

#### `git checkout <commit>`
The `git checkout` command is used to switch between different branches or to inspect previous commits within the repository. When you specify a commit ID (or other reference, such as a branch name) with `git checkout`, Git updates the working directory and the `HEAD` pointer to match the state of the repository at that particular commit.

- **Checking Out a Commit**: When you check out a commit by its ID (`git checkout <commit>`), Git puts the repository into a "detached HEAD" state. This means `HEAD` (the symbolic name for the currently checked out commit) points directly to the commit you've checked out, rather than to a branch reference. In this state:
  - You can view files and their contents as they were at the time of the commit.
  - You can make experimental changes (though these changes won't belong to any branch unless you create a new branch).
  - Any commits made while in a detached HEAD state will be more challenging to access if you move back to a branch without recording the commit ID.
  
# bandit 28

## Task 
There is a git repository at ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit28-git is the same as for the user bandit28.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

## Solution

3. **Listing Directory Contents:**
   ```
   bandit27@bandit:/tmp/tmp.eix858EfHM$ ls
   repo
   ```
   - `ls` command lists the contents of the current directory (`/tmp/tmp.eix858EfHM`).
   - Here, it shows that there is a directory named `repo` within `/tmp/tmp.eix858EfHM`.

4. **Navigating into a Directory:**
   ```
   bandit27@bandit:/tmp/tmp.eix858EfHM$ cd repo/
   ```
   - `cd repo/` command changes the current directory to `repo` which is located within `/tmp/tmp.eix858EfHM`.
   - After this command, the prompt changes to indicate that we are now in `/tmp/tmp.eix858EfHM/repo`.

5. **Listing Contents of a Directory:**
   ```
   bandit27@bandit:/tmp/tmp.eix858EfHM/repo$ ls
   README
   ```
   - `ls` command lists the contents of the current directory (`/tmp/tmp.eix858EfHM/repo`).
   - It shows that there is a file named `README` within `/tmp/tmp.eix858EfHM/repo`.

6. **Displaying File Contents:**
   ```
   bandit27@bandit:/tmp/tmp.eix858EfHM/repo$ cat README
   The password to the next level is: AVanL161y9rsbcJIsFHuw35rjaOM19nR
   ```
   - `cat README` command displays the contents of the file `README`.
   - The output shows that the password to access the next level (`bandit28`) is `AVanL161y9rsbcJIsFHuw35rjaOM19nR`.
